This is instruction how to deploy the application on your localhost
 
= Introduction =

This application is developed as an extension of Signavio Core Component (http://code.google.com/p/signavio-core-components/). We create a new query plugin enabling a process designer to gain and reuse a knowledge of other existing business processes which are similar to the designing process.

= Details =

Since our application is based on Signavio Core Component, the preliminary installation is referred to the installation of Signavio Core Platform. You can find it at http://code.google.com/p/signavio-core-components/wiki/InstallationInstructions. 

However, what you need to do after you successfully deployed an application is to:

1. create your own database (here we use MySQL).
2. Modify database setting in business-process-query/platform/src/com/signavio/warehouse/query/gateway/util/Configuration.java
3. create 4 tables by running SQL scripts which are in folder business-process-query/platform/SQL scrips/

Here we go! that's it. Now you can enjoy using our business process query.
